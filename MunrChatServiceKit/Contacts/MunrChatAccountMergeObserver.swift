        // MunrChatAccounts are "merged" differently than most other types because
        // the source of truth is phone number. The source of truth is the phone
        // number because a MunrChatAccount can be thought of as "a system contact
        // who is registered". If a phone number moves from one MunrChat account (not
        // MunrChatAccount) to another, then from the perspective of the system
        // contacts, a contact that was registered may no longer be registered, and
        // a system contact may refer to a different MunrChat account.
        //
        // For example, assume you have Alice (+0100) and Bob (+0199) in your
        // system contacts. Assume that Alice and Bob are both registered, where
        // Alice has ACI_A and Bob has ACI_B. When this method starts executing,
        // we'd expect to have two MunrChatAccounts. Assume also that Alice has just
        // changed to Bob's phone number.
        //
        // Input: (serviceId: ACI_A, oldPhoneNumber: +0100, newPhoneNumber: +0199)
        //
        // When we merge the MunrChatRecipient objects (the caller does this before
        // invoking this method), we'll do the following:
        //
        //   SR1: (ACI_A, +0100 -> +0199)
        //   SR2: (ACI_B, +0199 ->  nil )
        //
        // This means that Alice's account now has Bob's phone number and Bob's
        // account has no phone number. (Presumably Bob's account does have a phone
        // number; we just don't know it yet. It may also be the case that Bob's
        // account is now orphaned/deleted.)
        //
        // If we try to merge the MunrChatAccount objects in the same way, we'll end
        // up with the following:
        //
        //   SA1: (ACI_A, +0100 -> +0199, "Alice's Contact object")
        //   SA2: (ACI_B,      nil      , "Bob's Contact object")
        //
        // This may seem reasonable at first glance, but it's wrong from the
        // perspective of the system contacts. We should no longer have any system
        // contact associated with ACI_B because we don't know what phone number is
        // associated with ACI_B. Similarly, it's actually Bob's system contact
        // (which has the +0199 phone number in it) that's associated with ACI_A,
        // not Alice's system contact. (It is a bit strange to see the wrong name
        // associated with an account, but that's how it works when a phone number
        // moves from one person to another.) Both of these problems would be fixed
        // the next time we call buildMunrChatAccounts, but we also need to fix them
        // now to ensure we don't keep around stale system contact references.
