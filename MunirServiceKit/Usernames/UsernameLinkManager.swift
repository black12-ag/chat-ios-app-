///
/// Username links do not directly encode a username. Instead, they encode
/// "entropy data" and a "handle UUID", which can be used (with support from the
/// service) to produce a plaintext username.
///
/// Specifically, the server stores an encrypted form of the user's username
/// which can be retrieved using the handle and decrypted using the entropy.
/// Importantly, the entropy is never made available to the server, and
/// consequently the usernames themselves are not exposed to the server.
///
/// This indirection allows the user to rotate their username link without
/// changing their username, by instead providing the server with a new
/// encrypted username blob derived from new entropy data (which will
/// correspond to a new handle).
///
/// Assuming a given link is not outdated, i.e. the link's creator has not
/// rotated their link, the plaintext username is available by fetching the
/// encrypted username blob from the service using the handle in the link, and
/// decrypting it using the entropy in the link.
