/// A Task-based replacement for `OperationQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount`.
///
/// A `ConcurrentTaskQueue` with `concurrentLimit` set to `1` ("CTQ1") is
/// similar to, but not identical to, a `SerialTaskQueue` ("STQ"). The
/// former will reuse the current Task, whereas the latter creates a new
/// Task for each block that's enqueued. A CTQ1 can be replaced anywhere it
/// appears with an STQ without impacting execution ordering guarantees.
/// However, SQTs can't (always) be replaced by CTQ1s because the former
/// supports bridging synchronous and asynchronous contexts.
///
/// A ConcurrentTaskQueue is intended to be (somewhat) "invisible to the
/// caller", meaning that it doesn't violate the caller's expectations. For
/// example, ConcurrentTaskQueue supports cooperative cancellation, so it's
/// safe to use in methods intended to be cancellable. (This is different
/// than STQs -- those break the "chain of cancellation", and that might be
/// surprising to async callers of an async method.)
///
/// A ConcurrentTaskQueue serves as a suspension point/cancellation check.
/// This is different than invoking `block` directly (it's not "invisible"),
/// but it's roughly equivalent to calling `Task.checkCancellation()` just
/// prior to invoking `block`. Various other APIs -- `Task.sleep`, network
/// requests, Monitors -- similarly serve as cancellation points.
///
/// A ConcurrentTaskQueue doesn't "slow down" the reaction speed for
/// cancellations. If a block is executing when it's canceled, the reaction
/// speed will match that of the block that's executing. If a block hasn't
/// started executing, cancellation is immediate.
