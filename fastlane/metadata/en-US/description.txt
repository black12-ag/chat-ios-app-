MunrChat is a secure messaging app focused on privacy and simplicity. It is free and easy to use, with strong end-to-end encryption that keeps your communication completely private.

• Send texts, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs, and files for free. MunrChat uses your phone's data connection, so you avoid SMS and MMS fees.

• Call your friends with crystal-clear encrypted voice and video calls. Group calls supported for up to 50 people.

• Stay connected with group chats up to 1,000 people. Control who can post and manage group members with admin permission settings.

• Share image, text, and video Stories that disappear after 24 hours. Privacy settings keep you in charge of exactly who can see each Story.

• MunrChat is built for your privacy. We know nothing about you or who you're talking to. Our open source protocol means that we can't read your messages or listen to your calls. Neither can anyone else. No back doors, no data collection, no compromises.

• MunrChat is an independent project focused on privacy and security without any data collection or advertising.
